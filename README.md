## What is this? 🤔
A totally fair and not-at-all manipulative way to ask someone out on a date! This website gives your crush the *illusion* of choice while practically guaranteeing a "Yes!" through the power of... let's call it "user interface enhancement" 😈

## Features 🌟
- A "No" button that runs away faster than your commitment issues
- A "Yes" button that's more stable than your relationship status
- Cute GIFs to emotionally manipulate your target... I mean, your crush
- Pink everywhere because apparently that's what love looks like
- Mobile responsive design (because rejection should look good on all devices)

## How It Works 🎮
1. Send this to your crush
2. Watch them try to click "No" (spoiler alert: they can't)
3. Enjoy your guaranteed date!
4. ??? 
5. Profit!

## Technical Stuff 🤓
- HTML (Because we're basic like that)
- CSS (Making manipulation look pretty since 1996)
- JavaScript (The real MVP handling our evil mechanics)
- A whole lot of emotional manipulation

## Live Demo 🌐
Just kidding! Deploy it yourself, I'm not responsible for your love life.
